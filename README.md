`kbld` (pronounced: `kei·bild`) seamlessly incorporates image building and image pushing into your development and deployment workflows.

Features:

- Orchestrates image builds (delegates to tools like Docker, pack, kubectl-buildkit) and registry pushes
- Works with local Docker daemon and remote registries, for development and production cases
- Records metadata about image sources in annotation on Kubernetes resources (see examples below)
- Resolves image references to their digest form (*immutable*) ([details](https://carvel.dev/kbld/docs/latest/#why-digest-references))
- Provides a way to transport set of images in a single tarball between registries
  - maintaining exactly same digests, hence guaranteeing exactly same content
- Not specific to Kubernetes, but works really well with Kubernetes configuration files
